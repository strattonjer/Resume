**Senior Technical Writer – Medtronic** <br>
**Minneapolis, MN, March 2015 – current** 

I handle multiple projects simultaneously, working with multi-functional teams to create, edit, and publish well-written and compliant technical manuals for medical devices. My key focuses are on quality design and processes, writing for global audiences, cross-functional collaboration, efficient project management, and timely deliverables. Non-project initiatives include peer mentoring and onboarding of other technical writers, research and communication of regulatory standards and practice, and the creation of a global, online product warranty.

**Director of Client Services and Content Strategy – Nouvant** <br>
**Minneapolis, MN, Jan. 2012 – Jan. 2015**

I helped launch the SaaS company Nouvant, an online marketing and licensing platform for university research departments to commercialize their technologies. I worked with university technology transfer offices to provide content strategy and application training, and to translate client needs into the development of the Nouvant software.

I began my tenure writing – and leading a remote team of writers to write – technology marketing abstracts ([writing sample 1: Nouvant Technology Page](http://inventions.umich.edu/technologies/4537_functional-independence-measure-software-based-on-barthel-index-assesses-activities-of-daily-living-adls-with-animated-images)) from highly technical source material like patent filings and research publications. I soon took on client services, for which I managed the entire client life-cycle: sales, product demo, onboard, admin training, and ongoing support.

I worked closely with our development team to design both our clients’ customer-facing Web pages and the Nouvant administrative applications. I helped define user experience and workflows; to guide software improvements, features, and new modules; and to align product development with long-term business strategy.
 
Later, I initiated and remotely led software issue and improvement projects with an offshore team of contract developers. After leaving Nouvant in 2015, I consulted with the new parent company to ensure a smooth transfer and communication to clients. 

Highlights of my work include:
* Developed data-management and content-creation and tools and training (see writing sample – markdown template) 
* Trained clients and business partners in the use of third-party data management systems to populate Nouvant sites with well-formatted, search-engine-friendly content pages (see writing sample – Technology Publisher tutorial)
* Reviewed and audited public-facing content and backend data
* Created online and live, remote client training
* Wrote content for Nouvant corporate website (see writing sample – Nouvant Portfolio) and designed marketing materials (tradeshow booth and banner, slide show, flyers, etc.)
* Created wireframes and workflows to guide user-interface design and software architecture 
* Transferred for-print university licensing agreements to Web format with placeholders and variables for “click-through” online licensing (see work sample – licensing agreement)
* Collaborated with a multi-university focus group on the design of a draft “universal taxonomy” for research technologies
